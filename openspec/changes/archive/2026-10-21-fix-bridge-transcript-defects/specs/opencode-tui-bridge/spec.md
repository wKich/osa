# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Serve the OpenCode boot and config surface
The bridge SHALL answer the OpenCode `2.0.32` boot and config reads the TUI
performs — `/api/info`, agent/model/config reads, and the session/worktree list
routes — with spec-valid, internally consistent payloads so the TUI reaches a
usable composer without a "session location unavailable" dialog. Model values
SHALL come from the Maki child when it has announced one (`system.init.model`,
`assistant.model`) rather than from synthesized defaults; synthesized values
are permitted only before any child announcement and only for models the
child has not named.

#### Scenario: TUI boots against the bridge
- **WHEN** the OpenCode TUI is started with `--server` pointed at the bridge
- **THEN** every route it calls during boot is answered with a 2xx and a
  schema-valid body, and none returns an unhandled 404

#### Scenario: Location data is self-consistent
- **WHEN** the TUI reads session, project, and subpath location data
- **THEN** the project canonical equals the session directory, all paths are
  absolute, and `subpath` is empty, so the composer is not blocked

#### Scenario: Enum-bearing responses decode
- **WHEN** the TUI reads agent, model, or migration status enums
- **THEN** the primary agent is selectable (mode not `subagent`), migration
  status does not block submission, and no first-enum-value default prevents
  the user from sending a prompt

#### Scenario: Reported model is the child's model
- **WHEN** the Maki child announces `synthetic/fake` on `system.init` and the
  TUI renders a turn (status line, `session.step.started`, model list)
- **THEN** the reported provider and model id are the announced ones, and no
  route answers with a synthesized placeholder while a live child session
  exists

### Requirement: Translate the prompt into an OpenCode transcript
The bridge SHALL accept a prompt on the OpenCode prompt endpoint and emit SSE
event frames covering reasoning, text, tool, step, and execution boundaries as
Maki reports them, for both streamed and non-streamed Maki output. The
transcript SHALL be causally ordered: a frame representing the user's prompt
precedes every assistant frame the prompt caused, within a turn and across
turns.

#### Scenario: Plain text turn renders
- **WHEN** the user submits a prompt and Maki returns an assistant text part
- **THEN** the bridge emits `session.text.started`, one or more
  `session.text.delta`, and `session.text.ended` carrying the full text

#### Scenario: Reasoning and tool parts render
- **WHEN** the assistant message carries thinking and tool_use parts
- **THEN** the bridge emits the corresponding `session.reasoning.*` and
  `session.tool.input.*`/`session.tool.called` frames, and maps each
  tool_result to `session.tool.success` or `session.tool.failed`

#### Scenario: Turn completion is reported
- **WHEN** Maki emits a `result` frame
- **THEN** the bridge emits the matching `session.step.ended` with usage and
  finish status, and `session.execution.succeeded` or `session.execution.failed`

#### Scenario: Event stream opens correctly
- **WHEN** the TUI connects to the event stream
- **THEN** the first frame is `server.connected` and subsequent frames follow
  the wire format the real server uses

#### Scenario: Prompt renders before its response
- **WHEN** the user submits a prompt and the session produces assistant
  output, across one or more turns
- **THEN** the emitted transcript places a user-role representation of each
  prompt before the assistant frames it caused, so the rendered conversation
  interleaves Q-A-Q-A instead of grouping all answers before all questions
